In this homework, I have learnt how to sort and organize data frame by using tidyr to reshape and join to combine data, which I found to be quite useful for processing and trim
data.

The problem I have encounter during this homework practice: 
- loading csv files. Also, how should we deal with data that have sub-headers for each variable 




The links that guided me throught this homework: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbUWwuJeUC8  for tidyr's unite and seperate functions  

https://github.com/jennybc/lotr-tidy also for tidyr's gather and spread functions
